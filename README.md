With daily advancements in autonomous technology, the field of artificial intelligence and deep learning applications in this automotive industry has noticed continuously increasing participation. The advancing applications however come with their own vulnerabilities.The focus of this project is on the network security attacks. We use the KDD99 dataset to address the problem by employing supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms for detection and classification of the numerous attacks.

Datasets:

1. KDDcup '99 Data from Information and Computer Science University of California, Irvine : http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html

    " This is the data set used for The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition, which was held in conjunction with KDD-99 The Fifth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. The competition task was to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between bad connections, called intrusions or attacks, and good normal connections. This database contains a standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment."
    
2. NSL-KDD Dataset by Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity : https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html 

    "NSL-KDD is a data set suggested to solve some of the inherent problems of the KDD'99 data set. Although, this new version of the KDD data set still suffers from some of the problems discussed by McHugh and may not be a perfect representative of existing real networks, because of the lack of public data sets for network-based IDSs, we believe it still can be applied as an effective benchmark data set to help researchers compare different intrusion detection methods. Furthermore, the number of records in the NSL-KDD train and test sets are reasonable. This advantage makes it affordable to run the experiments on the complete set without the need to randomly select a small portion. Consequently, evaluation results of different research work will be consistent and comparable."
